**A storm is brewing and the mountains loom over a little cabin in the woods.** 
 
Daddy and his stepdaughter Riley have a cozy weekend to look forward to all to themselves, no Mommy to disturb them. They do what they do best: fuck. But they’re suddenly interrupted by a loud knock on the door. Who can it be? In this weather and at this late hour? Their world slowly starts to fall apart when another Daddy and stepdaughter duo enters the little cabin. Who are they and what do they want? More sexy fun? Or will everything fall apart? The night is getting dark, will they make it out of the fuck-cabin alive?
