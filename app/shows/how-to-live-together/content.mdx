**A show about cohabitation and the liminality of love.** 

Viktor and Linnea love each other. They really do. They love the moments they share and the life they live together. But the platitudes of everyday life can make this hard sometimes – hard to get underneath each other’s skin, to open up and find shared pleasure. Perhaps they need a helping hand…
How to live together is Glitchers’ eighth original piece. The show takes inspiration from 50s sci-fi, 90s rom-coms and the realism of the theatre canon.
